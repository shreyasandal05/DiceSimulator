# Project #1
A dice simulator using while loop in Python.

## Looping through dictionary: (important methods)


`dict()`-constructor that builds dictionary from key-value pair 

`items()`-key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time 

`enumerate()`-when looping through sequence, position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at same time 

`zip()`- to loop over two or more sequence at the same time, entries can be paired with zip() function

`reversed()`-to loop over a sequence in reverse 

`sorted()`-to loop in sorted order. Returns new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered

`set()`-on sequence, eliminates duplicates elements
